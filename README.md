## Rudimentary Responsive Site

Medium:
HTML5 & CSS3

A sample school assignment to git.

The primary objectives were:
1. Construct a fictitious business site - not ecommerce capable,
2. provide a site that will display elegantly on different viewports
     **@viewport { width: auto; }** - 
     **@media all and (max-width : 768px)**;
     **@media all and (max-width : 480px)**;
     **@media all and (max-width : 314px)**,
3. provide a navigational menu based solely off CSS, including several drill-down levels,
3. keep accessibility in mind and excercise functionality (for example, links - hovered, focus, visited),
4. include media queries and essential SEO so if the page were active it passed Googles ranking and search paramaters,
     Tested @ https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
5. enable tel etc. to be active on mobile device.

Note:  Some elements were made a bit outlandish to emphasize the feature.
